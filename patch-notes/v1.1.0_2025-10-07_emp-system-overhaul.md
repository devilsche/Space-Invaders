# Space Invaders v1.1.0 - EMP System Overhaul
**Release Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Codename:** "Electromagnetic Warfare"

## üöÄ Major Features

### ‚ö° EMP Weapon System (NEW)
- **Electromagnetic Pulse Weapon** - Disable enemy systems with area-of-effect attacks
- **Visual Effects**: 1024x1024 animated spritesheet with 4x4 frame animation
- **Smart Collision Detection**: Affects all enemy types including fly-in enemies and bosses
- **Power-Up Based**: Collect EMP charges through rare power-ups (5% drop chance)

### üéØ EMP Mechanics
- **Area of Effect**: 800px maximum radius expanding from 64px start size
- **Enemy Effects**:
  - **Weapon Disable**: 10 seconds of no enemy fire
  - **Movement Slow**: 90% speed reduction for 7 seconds  
  - **Visual Indicator**: Blue blinking indicator above affected enemies
- **Activation**: V-key (resolved conflict with Nuke E-key)
- **Cooldown**: 5 seconds between uses
- **Capacity**: 0-99 EMP charges (start with 0, +1 per power-up)

## üîß Technical Improvements

### üì¶ Configuration Consolidation
- **Unified Weapon System**: Merged `config/projectile.py` and `config/emp.py` into `config/weapon.py`
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing imports continue to work via aliases
- **Standardized Structure**: EMP now uses same configuration pattern as other weapons
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Reduced from 3 config files to 1 for all weapon systems

### üéÆ Gameplay Balance
- **Progressive EMP Collection**: Start with 0, collect up to 99 charges
- **Strategic Resource**: Each EMP charge is valuable and must be earned
- **Power-Up Rarity**: 5% drop chance makes EMP a strategic decision
- **Multi-Enemy Support**: Works on grid enemies, fly-in enemies, and boss enemies

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Key Conflict Resolution**: EMP moved to V-key to avoid Nuke weapon conflict
- **Enemy Movement**: Fixed EMP speed reduction for all movement types (grid, float, fly-in)
- **Collision Detection**: Improved positioning accuracy using rect.center coordinates
- **Visual Performance**: Removed excessive flicker effects, simplified to clean indicators

## üîÑ Code Refactoring
- **Import Cleanup**: Updated all weapon/projectile imports to use consolidated config
- **Asset Loading**: Unified EMP asset loading with other weapon systems  
- **Memory Optimization**: Static asset loading prevents repeated spritesheet processing
- **Error Handling**: Improved configuration validation and fallback systems

## üìã Configuration Changes
```python
# NEW: EMP integrated into WEAPON_CONFIG
"emp": {
    "dmg": 0,                           # No direct damage
    "radius": 800,                      # Maximum effect radius  
    "cooldown": 5000,                   # 5 second cooldown
    "amount": 0,                        # Start with 0 charges
    "charges_max": 99,                  # Maximum 99 charges
    "weapon_disable_duration": 10.0,    # 10s weapon disable
    "movement_disable_duration": 7.0,   # 7s movement slow
    "movement_speed_factor": 0.1,       # 10% speed (90% reduction)
    "activation_key": "V"               # V-key activation
}
```

## üéØ Tactical Gameplay Impact
- **Area Denial**: EMP creates safe zones by disabling multiple enemies
- **Boss Counter**: Effective against powerful boss enemies  
- **Resource Management**: Limited charges require strategic timing
- **Wave Control**: Can slow down entire enemy waves for tactical advantage

## üîÆ Developer Notes
- **Extensible Design**: EMP system framework can support future special weapons
- **Performance Optimized**: Static asset loading and efficient collision detection
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between weapon configs and game logic
- **Testing Ready**: Debug systems available for balance tweaking

## üìä Stats & Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 11 core game files updated
- **Code Reduction**: -2 config files, consolidated into unified system
- **New Assets**: 1024x1024 EMP spritesheet with 16 animation frames
- **Configuration Lines**: 200+ lines of weapon configs consolidated

## üéÆ How to Use EMP
1. **Collect Power-Ups**: Look for EMP power-ups (orange boxes, 5% drop rate)
2. **Accumulate Charges**: Each power-up gives +1 EMP charge (max 99)
3. **Activate**: Press **V** key when enemies are nearby
4. **Tactical Timing**: Use during heavy enemy waves for maximum effect
5. **Resource Management**: Each charge is precious - use strategically!

**Recommended Strategy**: Save EMP charges for boss fights or overwhelming enemy swarms!
